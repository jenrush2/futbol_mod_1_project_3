# Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.io/) Futbol project.

# Notes for Jen:
The instructions say that: Each of the methods described below (on instructions page for iteration 2 https://backend.turing.edu/module1/projects/futbol_pd/iterations/file_io_stats) should be implemented as instance methods on StatTracker in order for the spec harness to work properly.



All data tests in stat_tracker per the instructions. Classes that match the csv files: Game, Team, and Game_Team. Attributes will match column headers for each CSV file. Use spec harness to run tests on stat_tracker and my own tests for each class created.
